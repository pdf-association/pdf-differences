% ISO 32000-2:2020 subclause 9.3.6 Text rendering mode:
%
% The behaviour of the clipping modes requires further explanation. Glyph outlines shall begin
% accumulating if a BT operator is executed while the text rendering mode is set to a clipping mode or if
% it is set to a clipping mode within a text object. Glyphs shall accumulate until the text object is ended by
% an ET operator; the text rendering mode shall not be changed back to a nonclipping mode before that
% point.
% 
% At the end of the text object identified by the ET operator the accumulated glyph outlines, if any, shall
% be combined into a single path, treating the individual outlines as subpaths of that path and applying
% the non-zero winding number rule (see 8.5.3.3.2, "Non-zero winding number rule"). The current
% clipping path in the graphics state shall be set to the intersection of this path with the previous clipping
% path. As is the case for path objects, this clipping shall occur after all filling and stroking operations for
% the text object have occurred. It remains in effect until a previous clipping path is restored by an
% invocation of the Q operator.
% 
% NOTE 2 Due to the use of non-zero winding number rule, the direction of the paths comprising each
% glyph can cause different output for overlapping glyphs.
